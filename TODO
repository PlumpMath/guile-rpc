This file contains random to-do ideas.


* Better support fixed-size arrays

Using structs for fixed-size arrays leads to inefficient
encoding/decoding.  We must have native support that makes use of the
vector encoders/decoders of basic types.

* Support `quadruple'

* Statically allocate RPC buffers (non-reentrant variant)

May significantly improve performance, but may also require an
`xdr-max-type-size' procedure.

* Support some authentication flavors

* Compiler

** Generate more efficient encoders/decoders

Get source from `xdr/types.scm', perform loop unrolling, etc.

** Add stand-alone tools

`xdr-{decode,encode,describe}', `rpc-proxy', etc.
